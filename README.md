TypeScript Boilerplate
======================

This boilerplate project is the basis of many of my TypeScript projects. Feel free to use it for yourself!

Includes:
* Simple TypeScript setup ready to hit the ground running
* Automatic code linting and prettifying on each commit using eslint and prettier via husky and lint-staged
* My preferred set of linting rules for a consistent style

## How to use
- `npm run build` to once compile the TypeScript files inside `src/` into JavaScript files in the `/dist` directory
- `npm run watch` to continuously recompile the TypeScript files on any change
- You can run the compiled JavaScript output using `node dist/`
